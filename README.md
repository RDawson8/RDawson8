## Hello! My name is Ruby Dawson, and I am a student at ASU studying for a degree in Full-Stack Web Development! I work at Starbucks currently and am so proud I belong to the barista community. I love being creative and spending my time crafting and creating anything! I am working on acieving my goals and plans to their fullest-but making it a priority to learn something about myself through the whole journey! My favorite hobbies are cooking, baking, photography, crochet, and jewelry making, but I am planning to learn to sew and make stained glass this year! A fun fact about me is that Twenty-One Pilots is my favorite band, and I will never get tired of talking about them or listening to their music! :)

Here are some examples of my photography as well!
