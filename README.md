## Hello! My name is Ruby Dawson, and I am a student at ASU studying for a degree in Full-Stack Web Development! I work at Starbucks currently and am so proud I belong to the barista community. I love being creative and spending my time crafting and creating anything! I am working on achieving my goals and plans to their fullest--and making it a priority to learn something about myself through the journey! My favorite hobbies are cooking, baking, photography, crochet, and jewelry making, but I plan to learn sewing and stained glass this year! A fun fact about me is that my favorite band is Twenty-One Pilots, and I will never get tired of talking about them or listening to their music! :)
